Pizza Order Form

Create a one-page site that contains a pizza order form.
The ordering process should be broken down into three steps.

    Step 1: Choose pizza details
    Size (small $7, medium $9, large $12)
    Crust (thin, pan, gluten free)
    Meats ($1.50 each)
    Veggies ($1.00 each)

    Step 2: Enter delivery information
    Name
    Address
    Phone

    Step 3: Order confirmation
    Display all of the pizza details and customer information from steps 1 and 2
    Display the subtotal, calculated tax (use a rate of 5.1 %), delivery fee ($2),
    and the total amount due

    Format all amounts to two decimal places.


Requirements

Design and structure

    Use external CSS and JS files.
    Make sure you have styled text and colors, etc.
    Make the page look like it belongs to a pizza delivery company.

Sequenced order form

    Your form must be broken down into three steps, where only one step is shown at a time.
    You can use the three tabs that were demonstrated in class.
    Another options is to show and hide <div> elements,
    providing the user with "Next" and "Previous" buttons to step through the order form.

Forms

    Use the appropriate input field types for the type of data you are collecting.
    Fields should be accessible (Hint: use <label> elements).

Calculations

    The order form should calculate the total cost correctly using the logic defined above.
    All amounts should be formatted to two decimal places.

Documentation

    Make sure all of your code is well organized.
    JavaScript code should be documented with comments throughout the code.
